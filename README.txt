restAssuredTraining project is a practice environment where I use some tools to execute Rest API calls and Assertions.
The objective of this exercise is to better understand how to use the Rest Assured framework.

Tools used:
- Eclipse IDE
- Java (jdk-10.0.1)
- Maven for dependencies/libraries management
- TestNG for Test Cases execution and management (also for assertions)
- Rest Assured for Rest calls (io.restassured)
- reqres.in/api as a System Under Testing (SUT). Please visit https://reqres.in/ for better API explanation
- jsonpath (com.jayway.jsonpath) to handle Restful Responses
- jackson-databind (com.fasterxml.jackson.core) to serialize JsonPath objects into User Defined classes
